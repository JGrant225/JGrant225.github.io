<h2>Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!</h2>

<h3>Here are the instructions:</h3>

<p>A random number has been generated from 1-100, and you have 5 guesses to figure it out!<br>
Enter your guess into the field, and we'll tell you if it's too high, too low, or just right!
</p>


    <label for="guess">Enter your Guess:</label><br>
    <input type="number" max="100" min="1" id="guess" name="guess"><br>
    <button onclick="guessCheck()">Submit</button>




<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

const n = Math.floor(Math.random()*100) + 1

let i = 0;

function guessCheck(){
let g = document.getElementById("guess").value


g = Number(g)


     if(g == n){
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
        "Nice! You got it right!"
        
    }else if(g > n){
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
        "Sorry, your guess was too high. Try again!"
        i++;
    }else if(g < n){
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        "Sorry, your guess was too low. Try again!"
        i++;
    }
    if(i >= 5){
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "You've run out of guesses! The correct number was: " + n
