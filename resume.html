          <p>In the summer of 2024, I worked with Professor Eman Abdullah AlOmar on a project studying the habits of software engineers when refactoring their code using ChatGPT. Over the summer, our team completed a research paper and published a website detailing our methodology and results in depth. More information about my role in the project can be found below.</p>

            <p>Through the months of May-September of 2024, I was able to work under a professor of Software Engineering to research the habits of software developers when consulting ChatGPT to help refactor their code. We specifically focused on how effective of a tool ChatGPT turned out to be for the developers in the dataset, and what seemed to be the best methods developers employed when prompting ChatGPT to get a satisfying result. My research team published a website delving further into our methodology and results, which can be found at this <a href="https://sites.google.com/stevens.edu/refactoringprogramspinnacle24/home?authuser=1">Link</a></p>
            <p>My responsibilities as an Undergraduate Research Assitant included:</p>

              <li>Utilizing Microsoft Excel to organize our findings and create detailed plots/graphs of our results.</li>
              <li>Developing and structuring innovative taxonomies to effectively display research findings to a general audience</li>
